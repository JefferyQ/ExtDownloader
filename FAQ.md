###1. What kind of files this can download?
A. This app can download any kind of file, in any size, without limitation. Whereas opening and previewing are limited to types which iOS supports internally.

###2. What kind of archives and compressed format are supported?
**A.** Zip, 7z, rar and tar.gz are supported, which are 95% archive files available on internet. But password-protected and multi-parted files are not supported yet. Please consider 7z files size are limited to memory of your device and it's slow to extract it in comparison to other files.

###3. What happens to download progress if I exit app?

###4. Which sources are supported by this app?
**A.** It’s better to say which aren’t, In general these types of websites are not supported to download:
* Sites which need complicated or cookie-based authentication like email services  (e.g. Gmail). Even desktop download managers are not able to fetch files from these sources. The best solution for these kind of sources is using native app for these services
* Upload services which offer indirect links on free services e.g. RapidShare or Upload.to. You should either obtain premium services or use desktop browser to download files from these services
* Services which offer copyrighted materials like Youtube and SoundCloud won’t allow you to download contents directly according to App Store limitations. Though there are few third-party sites offer proxy links to contents of these sites. These third-party link providers are somehow usable in our app.
* Downloading from torrent or similar services are not supported according to App Store limitation.
